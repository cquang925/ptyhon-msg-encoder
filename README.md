# ptyhon-msg-encoder
simple program that will encode a message and decode.
created to assist in learning python.
dictionary is first created and then program asks user to type a message.
program then converts message into a code and prints the code.
program then ask to type in a coded message and decodes the message.
future improvements - add uppercase letters and create try blocks to catch errors

updated 2/23/20.
created separate files for main menu, encoder, decoder and randomizer
main menu starts program and asks what user wants to do
encoder will code a message
decoder deciphers a message
randomizer creates a key
known bugs - need to create loop for main menu. need to catch errors for invalid user entries. need to clear list for encoder, after user initially inputs message
